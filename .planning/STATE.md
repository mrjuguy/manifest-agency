## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- GitHub as coordination layer (auditable, human-readable, no proprietary state)
- Hook-based trust (enforcement at execution boundaries, not runtime)
- Declarative agent definitions (CEO invokes intent, agents encode implementation)
- Dynamic worktrees (isolation without merge conflicts, outcome-based cleanup)
- Agents as disposable resources (scale to work, not the other way around)

**From 01-01 (Repository Foundation):**
- Local git config for submodule behavior (not global)
- LF line endings normalized across platform via .gitattributes

**From 01-02 (Agent Manifest Schema):**
- JSON Schema draft-07 for wide IDE compatibility
- Strict validation (additionalProperties: false) to catch typos
- Optional triggers for both direct invocation and auto-routing
- Provider-specific extensions in providers.* namespace
